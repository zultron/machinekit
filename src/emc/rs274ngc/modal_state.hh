/**
 * C++ version of state_tag_t structure to stuff interp state info in a motion message.
 * Previously, this information was stored only in the interpreter, and as
 * vectors of g codes, m codes, and settings. Considering that the write_XXX
 * and gen_XXX functions had to jump through hoops to translate from a settings
 * struct, the extra packing here isn't much more complex to deal with, and
 * will cost much less space in an NML message.
 *
 * Using this class means we can work with a bitset instead of raw bitmasking
 * operations. Also, because we're inheriting from the C struct, copy /
 * assignment is valid.
