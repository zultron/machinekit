This test runs and aborts a test .ngc program several times with
various blend mode and tolerance settings.  At various points at
execution, it compares expected and active settings for blend mode
(using the status buffer) and blend tolerances (using X coordinates
collected by halsampler).

This test replicates Github Issue #177.
